# Power Trade Indicator MT4 ReadMe File

## Description
This code represents the Power Trade Indicator for MT4, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The indicator calculates the power trade value based on a specified period and provides entry signals when the value exceeds a threshold. It also includes settings for profit target and rebound zone for stop loss.

## Input Parameters
- `period` (default: 14) - The period for calculating the indicator
- `threshold` (default: 30) - The threshold for entry signals
- `profitTarget` (default: 0.005) - The profit target for taking profits
- `reboundZone` (default: 0.002) - The rebound zone for establishing stop loss

## Initialization
The initialization function `OnInit()` sets up the indicator and calculates the indicator values. It uses the `calculatePowerTrade()` function to calculate the power trade value for each bar.

## Deinitialization
The deinitialization function `OnDeinit()` is responsible for cleaning up any resources used by the indicator. In this case, it frees the powerTradeBuffer array.

## Calculation
The calculation function `calculatePowerTrade()` calculates the power trade value for a given index. It sums up the closing prices for the specified period and divides it by the period length.

## Trading
The trading function `OnTick()` is called on each tick and checks for entry signals based on the power trade value. If the value exceeds the threshold, a buy order is placed with a stop loss and take profit level calculated based on the rebound zone and profit target. The order placement is validated and relevant messages are printed.
